# Disaster-Resilient-Housing-Risk-And-Cost-Optimization
-Disaster-Resilient Housing Risk & Cost Optimization (NIT Srinagar Internship — 2025)

-Developed a Random Forest classifier to predict disaster risk levels (Low/Medium/High) using environmental features

-Built a Random Forest-based material recommendation system to identify durable and cost-efficient construction options for disaster-prone regions

-Implemented Linear Regression to estimate material cost per sq. ft. while balancing affordability and safety

-Trained, tested, and visualized results using scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps

-Worked on synthetic data
